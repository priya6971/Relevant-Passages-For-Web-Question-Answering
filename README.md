# Dependenices
1. Simple Transformers : Simple Transformer models are built with a particular Natural Language Processing task in mind. Each such model comes equipped with features and functionalities designed to best fit the task that they are intended to perform.The high-level process of using Simple Transformers models follows the same pattern.
 a. Initialize a task-specific model
 b. Train the model with train model()
 c. Evaluate the model with eval model()
 d. Make predictions on unlabelled data with predict()
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
